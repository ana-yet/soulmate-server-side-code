# SoulMate - MERN Matrimonial Platform (Backend)

#### [Live Link](https://soul-m-ate.vercel.app/)

This repository contains the backend server for the **SoulMate** application. It is a robust RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to handle all data management, user authentication, and business logic for the matrimonial platform.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication using Firebase Admin SDK to verify user identity and protect routes.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Middleware to differentiate between regular users and administrators, restricting access to sensitive endpoints.

- **Comprehensive Biodata Management**: Full CRUD operations for user biodata, including creation, updates, and fetching detailed profiles.

- **Advanced Filtering & Pagination**: Dynamic server-side filtering for biodata listings based on age, gender, division, and search keywords, with efficient pagination.

- **User Interaction System**: Functionality for users to favourite profiles and request contact information.

- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing with Stripe for handling contact request fees.

- **Admin Oversight**: A suite of admin-only endpoints for managing users, approving premium requests, handling contact requests, and publishing success stories.

- **Dashboard Analytics**: Specialized endpoints to aggregate and deliver statistics for both user and admin dashboards.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js

- **Framework**: Express.js

- **Database**: MongoDB (with MongoDB Node.js Driver)

- **Authentication**: Firebase Admin SDK (for token verification)

- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe

- **Environment Management**: `dotenv`

- **Middleware**: `cors`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the backend server running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)

- npm or yarn

- A MongoDB database (local or cloud-hosted like MongoDB Atlas)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder-name>

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
# or
yarn install

```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables.

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000

# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"

# Firebase Admin SDK
# (Encode your Firebase service account JSON key to Base64)
FIREBASE_ADMIN_KEY="your_base64_encoded_firebase_service_account_key"

# Stripe Secret Key
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_KEY="sk_test_..."

# Frontend URL for CORS
CLIENT_SITE="http://localhost:5173"

```

> **Security Note**: To get your `FIREBASE_ADMIN_KEY`, you must first generate a private key JSON file from your Firebase project settings. Then, encode the entire content of that JSON file into a single Base64 string.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```
npm start
# or
yarn start

```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
